*Lesson 02 is an abbreviated version of [this document](https://github.com/czbeatty/FRC-Romi-Programming-Course/blob/main/Lessons/Romi%20Lesson%202%20-%20Intro%20to%20Java%20-%20Variables.pdf). Please use it for reference if necessary.*

1. Power on the Romi and connect to its WiFi network, then open the robot code reopsitory. Pull any new changes from GitHub.

2. Start the program by pressing F5, and drive the Romi around!

3. Find the file `Main.java` and add code before the line `RobotBase.startRobot(Robot::new);`. Print out a message of your choice to the console using the function `System.out.println(text)`. Where does this message appear when you start the program?

4. Change the drive logic such that your forward speed is scaled down by 50%. This control is part of the file `Drivetrain.java`.

5. Play around with other scaling factors! For example, can you make turning more sensitive? What does a negative value do?

6. Commit and push any changes you've made.
